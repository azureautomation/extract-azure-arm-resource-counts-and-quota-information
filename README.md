Extract Azure ARM resource counts and quota information
=======================================================

            

 


This script can be used to export all providers and resource type counts to a csv file along with the ARM VM quota information for each active Azure location.


Please update the file path variable to the required location depending on your system set-up.


An out-gridview will be displayed to allow the selection of particular subscriptions you have access to.


The csv file will be overwritten on every execution.


Update:
July 18th 2017:  Adding Powershell version check for Subscription output.
 Adding Region filter

 

 


 

 

 


 




        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
